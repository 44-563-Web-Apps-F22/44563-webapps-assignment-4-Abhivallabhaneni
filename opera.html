        <h3>The Grand Duke </h3>
        <h5>SCENE.—Pavilion in the Court of Barataria.  Marco and
            Giuseppe, magnificently dressed, are seated on two thrones,
            occupied in cleaning the crown and the sceptre.  The Gondoliers
            are discovered, dressed, some as courtiers, officers of rank,
            etc., and others as private soldiers and servants of various
            degrees.  All are enjoying themselves without reference to social
            distinctions—some playing cards, others throwing dice, some
            reading, others playing cup and ball, "morra", etc.</h5>

<h6>FIA.</h6>           <p>Though obedience is strong,
            Curiosity's stronger—
       We waited for long,
            Till we couldn't wait longer.</p>
            <br>

<h6>VIT.</h6>           <p>It's imprudent, we know,
            But without your society
       Existence was slow,
            And we wanted variety—</p>
            <br>

<h6>BOT.</h6>     <p>Existence was slow, and we wanted variety.</p>
<br>

<h6>ALL.</h6>      <p>So here we are, at the risk of our lives,
  From ever so far, and we've brought your wives—
  And to that end we've crossed the main,
  And don't intend to return again!</p>
  <br>
  <h6>SONG—LUDWIG.</h6>
  
 <p> Ten minutes since I met a chap
  Who bowed an easy salutation—
Thinks I, "This gentleman, mayhap,
  Belongs to our Association."
        But, on the whole,
              Uncertain yet,
        A sausage-roll
              I took and eat—
That chap replied (I don't embellish)
By eating three with obvious relish.</p>

<p>(Enter Gianetta and Tessa.  They rush to the arms of Marco and
Giuseppe.)</p><br>

<h6>GIU.</h6>      <p>Tessa!</p>
<br>
<h6>TES.</h6>          <p>Giuseppe!</p>      <p>{All embrace.}</p>
<br>
<h6>GIA.</h6>      <p>Marco!</p>
<br>
<h6>MAR.</h6>           <p>Gianetta!</p>
<br>

<p>TESSA and GIANETTA.</p>
<br>

<h6>TES.</h6>          <p>After sailing to this island—</p>
<br>
<h6>GIA.</h6>                <p>Tossing in a manner frightful,</p>
<br>
<h6>TES.</h6>          <p>We are all once more on dry land—</p>
<br>
<h6>GIA.</h6>                <p>And we find the change delightful,</p>
<br>
<h6>TES.</h6>          <p>As at home we've been remaining—
            We've not seen you both for ages,</p>
            <br>
<h6>GIA.</h6>           <p>Tell me, are you fond of reigning?—
            How's the food, and what's the wages?</p>
            <br>
<h6>TES.</h6>          <p>Does your new employment please ye?—</p>
<br>
<h6>GIA.</h6>                <p>How does Royalizing strike you?</p>
<br>
<h6>TES.</h6>          <p>Is it difficult or easy?—</p>
<br>
<h6>GIA.</h6>                <p>Do you think your subjects like you?</p>
<br>
<h6>TES.</h6>          <p>I am anxious to elicit,</p>
